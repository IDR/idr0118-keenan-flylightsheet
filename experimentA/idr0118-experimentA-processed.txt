For all images in this study, wild type expression of genes (tll, hkb, fkh, byn, and wg) was observed through MS2 dot identification.  Spatiotemporal location of dots and nuclei can be found in the excel files labeled 'gene_sample#_Dots' and 'gene_sample#_Nuclei' respectively.  Identification of dots that overlap with nuclei can be found in the excel file 'gene_sample#_Compartmentalization'.
